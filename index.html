                    I am interested in applying data driven solutions to engineering problems in electrical, chemical, and biomedical engineering. I am currently interning at AMD as a Foundry Technology 
                    Operations Co-op. </p>
                    
                <p id = about-me-text>
                    I am also involved in undergraduate research in the Akinwande Nano Research Group at UT Austin where I work on data processing for RF sensors 
                    and developing machine learning models to accurately predict blood pressure. You can find some of my favorite projects in the projects tab! In my free time I like 
                    to paddleboard on the Colorado River, ski, and cook with my friends.
